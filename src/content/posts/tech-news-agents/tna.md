## Demo on [HF-Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/saikanov/tech_news_agents)

I made this AI Agent for personal use. My friend and I recently started a WhatsApp Channel to share tech news, and you can join [here](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vaoq9JP2Jl8KwDClXt10).

### The Problem & Solution
Usually, we find content just by scrolling around the internet, and if something looks interesting, we share it. But sometimes, we miss updates, and that’s a bit of a problem—who wants to follow a channel that isn’t consistent?

So, I came up with the idea of building this Multi-AI Agent:
1. **Finding Content**: It searches popular websites for tech news that might be worth sharing.
2. **Summarizing & Tagging**: Another agent summarizes, tags, scores the content, and even gives an estimated reading time.
3. **Formatting for Sharing**: The final agent formats everything nicely so we can quickly share it.

Now, we have a steady flow of content for the channel while we are too busy to scroll XD.
