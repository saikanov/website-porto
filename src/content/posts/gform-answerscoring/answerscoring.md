## Demo on [HF-Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/saikanov/G-Form_Quiz_Answering_)

This AI app is designed to help teachers with scoring essay-like questions. I know scoring is an essential part of teaching, but teachers often aren't compensated enough to handle all the administrative and technical work involved. That’s why I created this app. The output is fairly consistent, showing only about a 5-10% relative percent difference in results.

### Key Features
- **Customizable Scoring Criteria**: Teachers can adjust scoring aspects according to their preferences, so the app isn’t solely reliant on AI.
- **Additional Reference Documents**: Adding reference materials can help improve the quality of the scoring.

### Recommendation
While this app can be a helpful tool, I recommend that teachers use it for testing purposes first and don’t rely fully on the AI’s scores. Evaluate some of its output, then decide whether to integrate it into your grading process.

### Future Plans
In future versions, I plan to make this app even more customizable, allowing teachers to fine-tune settings to better meet their specific needs.
